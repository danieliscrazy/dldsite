    <p class="mb-2 font-[Comic_Sans_MS] text-center mx-auto max-w-150">Oh, interesting. I'm trying to submit this to Flavortown, and it appears that my project is about 6 minutes short of enough time to do a second devlog. This is probably because I did all the edits that I did recently in GitHub browser and not in VSCode. Woops! So that I can count recorded time, I am typing this additional section here! This technically isn't time inflation, because I am actually typing this and it is actually part of my project! This is important context that people need to know when visiting my site. OK, I think that's enough typing now! Byebye!</p>
